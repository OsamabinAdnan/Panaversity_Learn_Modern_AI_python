    "##  **1. What is OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)` is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects and classes, rather than functions and logic. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects. OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and their relationships in a more intuitive and structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you‚Äôre building a car simulation, you might create a Car class. Each car in your program would be an object (instance) of that class, with attributes like color, speed, and model, and behaviors like accelerate() or brake()."

    "## **Why use OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Modularity:` OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, reusable components (objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Reusability:` Classes and objects can be reused across different parts of a program or in entirely different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Maintainability:` Code is easier to maintain and update because it‚Äôs organized into logical units.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Scalability:` OOP makes it easier to scale and extend programs as requirements grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Real-world modeling:` OOP closely mirrors real-world entities, making it easier to understand and design systems."
