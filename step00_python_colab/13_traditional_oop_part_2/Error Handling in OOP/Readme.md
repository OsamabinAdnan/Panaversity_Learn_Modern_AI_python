# **Error Handling in OOP**

Error handling is a critical aspect of writing robust and reliable code. In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), you can handle errors by raising exceptions in methods and creating custom exceptions to represent specific error conditions in your application.

## **Raising Exceptions in Methods**
In Python, you can raise exceptions using the raise keyword. This is useful for signaling that an error has occurred in a method.

## **Custom Exceptions in Classes**
Custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that inherit from Pythonâ€™s built-in Exception class. They allow you to define specific error types for your application.

## **Example: Handling Errors in OOP**
Letâ€™s create a BankAccount class to demonstrate error handling in OOP. Weâ€™ll raise exceptions for invalid operations and define a custom exception for insufficient funds.

### **Code Example**
```python
# Custom exception for insufficient funds
class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, balance, amount):
        super().__init__(f"Insufficient funds: balance is {balance}, but {amount} was requested.")
        self.balance = balance
        self.amount = amount

# BankAccount class
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_holder, balance=0):
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self.balance = balance

    # Method to deposit money
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount must be positive.")
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}")

    # Method to withdraw money
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount must be positive.")
        if self.balance < amount:
            raise InsufficientFundsError(self.balance, amount)
        self.balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrew {amount}. New balance: {self.balance}")

    # Method to display account details
    def display(self):
        print(f"Account Holder: {self.account_holder}, Balance: {self.balance}")

# Create a BankAccount instance
account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)

# Deposit money
try:
    account.deposit(500)  # Output: Deposited 500. New balance: 1500
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# Withdraw money
try:
    account.withdraw(2000)  # Raises InsufficientFundsError
except InsufficientFundsError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Insufficient funds: balance is 1500, but 2000 was requested.
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# Display account details
account.display()  # Output: Account Holder: Alice, Balance: 1500
```
```bash
Deposited 500. New balance: 1500
Insufficient funds: balance is 1500, but 2000 was requested.
Account Holder: Alice, Balance: 1500
```

## **Explanation of the Code**

1. **Custom Exception (InsufficientFundsError):**

    * Inherits from Pythonâ€™s Exception class.

    * Includes a custom error message that displays the account balance and the requested withdrawal amount.

2. **BankAccount Class:**

    * deposit method: Raises a ValueError if the deposit amount is not positive.

    * withdraw method: Raises a ValueError if the withdrawal amount is not positive and raises InsufficientFundsError if the balance is insufficient.

    * display method: Prints the account holderâ€™s name and balance.

3. **Error Handling:**

    * The try and except blocks are used to catch and handle exceptions raised by the deposit and withdraw methods.

## **Key Takeaways**

* `Raising exceptions` is a way to signal errors in methods.
* `Custom exceptions` allow you to define specific error types for your application.
* Use try and except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
* Error handling in OOP ensures that your program can recover from unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to users.

This example demonstrates how to handle errors in Python OOP effectively. ðŸš€
