    "# **The Frozenset**\n",
    "----\n",
    "In Python, a `frozenset` is an `immutable` (unchangeable) version of a set. It is a collection of unique elements, just like a set, but it cannot be modified after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key features of a `frozenset`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutable**: A `frozenset` cannot be modified after it is created. You cannot add, remove, or change elements in a `frozenset`.\n",
    "2. **Ordered**: Like sets, `frozensets` are unordered in Python versions before 3.7. However, from Python 3.7 onwards, `frozensets` maintain their insertion order, just like sets.\n",
    "3. **Hashable**: `frozensets` are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in other sets.\n",
    "4. **Unique elements**: A `frozenset` can only contain unique elements, just like a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between a `set` and a `frozenset` in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutability**:\n",
    "   - `set`: Mutable (can be modified after creation)\n",
    "   - `frozenset`: Immutable (cannot be modified after creation)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modification methods**:\n",
    "   - `set`: Supports methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, `clear()`, `pop()`, `update()`\n",
    "   - `frozenset`: Does not support any modification methods\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hashability**:\n",
    "   - `set`: Not hashable (cannot be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in other sets)\n",
    "   - `frozenset`: Hashable (can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in other sets)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Thread safety**:\n",
    "   - `set`: Not thread-safe (multiple threads can modify the set simultaneously, leading to inconsistencies)\n",
    "   - `frozenset`: Thread-safe (since it's immutable, it's safe to access from multiple threads)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Syntax**:\n",
    "   - `set`: Created using the `set()` function or the `{}` syntax (e.g., `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`)\n",
    "   - `frozenset`: Created using the `frozenset()` function (e.g., `my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])`)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use cases**:\n",
    "   - `set`: Suitable for situations where you need to frequently add or remove elements (e.g., when filtering data)\n",
    "   - `frozenset`: Suitable for situations where you need an immutable collection (e.g., when using it as a key in a dictionary or as an element in another set)\n",

    "### **Here's how it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Counting**: Python uses a reference counting algorithm to track the number of references to each object. When an object is created, its reference count is set to 1. Each time a new reference to the object is created (e.g., assigning it to a variable or passing it as an argument), the reference count is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Garbage Collection**: When an object's reference count reaches 0, it is no longer needed and becomes eligible for garbage collection. The garbage collector periodically runs in the background to identify and free up memory occupied by these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Python's garbage collector is:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automatic**: You don't need to manually manage memory or explicitly free up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Periodic**: The garbage collector runs periodically to clean up memory.\n",
    "* **Reference-based**: It uses reference counting to determine which objects are no longer needed.\n",
