    "### Here you need to know the concept of file pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a `file pointer` (also called a `file cursor` or `file position indicator`) is an internal marker that keeps track of the `current position` in a file where the next read or write operation will occur. When you open a file, the file pointer is initialized to a specific position (`usually 0, the beginning of the file`), and it moves automatically as you read from or write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. Starting Position:\n",
    "  * r (read mode): Pointer starts at 0 (beginning of the file).\n",
    "  * a (append mode): Pointer starts at the end of the file.\n",
    "  * w (write mode): The file is truncated (erased), and the pointer starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How It Moves:\n",
    "  * When you read/write data, the pointer moves forward by the number of bytes/characters processed.\n",
    "  * Example: Reading 10 characters moves the pointer 10 positions forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Manual Control:\n",
    "  * Use seek(offset) to move the pointer to a specific byte position.\n",
    "  * Use tell() to check the current pointer position."
